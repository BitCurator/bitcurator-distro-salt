# bitcurator-distro-salt support packages

This directory includes some support packages for BitCurator that may be available elsewhere, but are retained here due to issues involving continued online access or compatibility between versions.

## Libewf

Libewf is in active development. Many projects (TSK, bulk_extractor, among others) depend on earlier versions. Acquiring earlier source trees is becoming more diffiucult, so libewf-20140608 has been included here for convenience. Using a newer version of libewf **may break TSK or the BitCurator reporting tools**!
